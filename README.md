# SNIFF: Scenario-based Flexible Modeling and Scalable Falsification for Reconfigurable CPSs
## Overview
SNIFF is a scenario-based ***modeling*** and ***falsification*** tool for ***reconfigurable CPSs***.
It supports:
- `hierarchical modeling for reconfigurable CPS`:
  providing template models for agent inherent features, together with an instantiation mechanism to activate single agent's runtime behavior, communication configurations for multiple agents' connected behaviors, and scenario task configurations for their dynamic topologies.

- `temporal logic falsification for reconfigurable CPS`:
  employing classification-model-based optimization to explore search space effectively and cut unnecessary system simulations and robustness calculations for efficiency.
